				Welcome to my homepage!

				I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at Tsinghua University. I obtained my Ph.D in Economics from the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Master in Statistics from Department of Statistics,Wharton School. My research spans several fields: <b> Macroeconomics, Finance, Machine Learning, Networks, and the Chinese Economy</b>. However, it shares a common theme: the use of big data to understand the role of networks in investor behavior, firm decision making, asset pricing, the business cycle, and systemic risk.
		</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
		Under this theme, my work can be divided into three branches: <br> <b> i)</b>  Innovation network and its implication on business cycle, asset pricing, and investment;  <br> <b>ii)</b> Equity-holding network and its implication on corporate finance, governance, and monetary policy; <br> <b>iii)</b> Machine learning.</p>
