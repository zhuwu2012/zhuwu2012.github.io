				Welcome to my homepage!

			<p class="text-justify">
				I am a fifth-year Ph.D in Economics, the University of Pennsylvania. My current research spans several fields - Finance, Macro, Statistical Learning, Theory, and the Chinese Economy.

		<p class="text-justify">
		My work shares a common  theme - use detailed micro data (usually big data) to emphasize the role of networks in investors' behaviors, firm decision, asset pricing, business cycle and systemic risk. I am also statistical learning to recover the underlying networks or make prediction in portfolio management. 		
		</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
		Under this theme, my current work can be divided into three branches. i) Equity-holding network and its implication in corporate finance, governance, and macroeconomics; ii) Innovation network and its implication in asset pricing, business cycle, and investment; iii) Use statistical learning to make prediction or learn the underlying networks in a networking world.
